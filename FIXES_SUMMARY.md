# Comprehensive Fixes Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:

### 1. Dark Mode Persistence âœ…
**Files Modified:**
- `App.js` - Added useEffect to apply dark mode on load from localStorage
- `Settings.js` - Save dark mode to localStorage when toggled

**How it works:**
- When you toggle dark mode, it saves to localStorage
- On page refresh, App.js reads localStorage and applies dark mode
- Dark mode now persists across sessions

## NOTES:

Due to the large scope (10 major features), I'm implementing in priority order:
1. Quick fixes first (immediate value)
2. Medium tasks next (important features)
3. Large features last (complex implementations)

This ensures you get working improvements incrementally rather than waiting for everything at once.

**Current Focus**: Fixing quick wins (#2-4) to give you immediate improvements.
