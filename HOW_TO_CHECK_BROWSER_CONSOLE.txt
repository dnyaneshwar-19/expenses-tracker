🔍 HOW TO CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE (NOT TERMINAL)
===============================================

YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG CONSOLE!

The terminal shows webpack compilation.
I need to see the BROWSER CONSOLE which shows API calls.

===============================================
HOW TO OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE:
===============================================

1. Go to your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
2. Make sure you're on http://localhost:3000
3. Press F12 key (or right-click → Inspect)
4. Click "Console" tab at the top
5. You should see logs like:
   - "Fetching dashboard data for user: X"
   - "Raw expenses response: [...]"
   - "Fetching expenses..."

===============================================
WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN BROWSER CONSOLE:
===============================================

After Login (Dashboard):
------------------------
✅ "Fetching dashboard data for user: 1"
✅ "Raw expenses response: []" or "[{...}]"
✅ "Raw budgets response: []"
✅ "Dashboard stats calculated: {...}"

After Adding Expense:
---------------------
✅ "Fetching expenses..."
✅ "Expenses response: [{...}]"

If you see ERRORS (red text):
------------------------------
❌ "Error fetching expenses: ..."
❌ "401 Unauthorized"
❌ "Network Error"
❌ "Cannot read properties of undefined"

===============================================
STEP BY STEP:
===============================================

1. Open browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Login
5. Look at console - what appears?
6. Click "Expenses"
7. Click "Add Expense"
8. Fill form and submit
9. Look at console - what appears?
10. Take screenshot of console
11. Share with me

===============================================
SCREENSHOT EXAMPLE:
===============================================

The console should look like this:

Console
-------
> Fetching dashboard data for user: 1
> Raw expenses response: []
> Raw budgets response: []
> Dashboard stats calculated: {total: 0, thisMonth: 0}
> Fetching expenses...
> Expenses response: []

===============================================
IF EXPENSES DON'T SHOW:
===============================================

The browser console will tell us WHY:

Possibility 1: API returns empty array
  Console shows: "Expenses response: []"
  Meaning: No expenses in database

Possibility 2: API call fails
  Console shows: "Error fetching expenses: ..."
  Meaning: Backend issue

Possibility 3: Data structure mismatch
  Console shows: "Expenses response: undefined"
  Meaning: Response format wrong

===============================================
PLEASE DO THIS:
===============================================

1. Open browser (not terminal)
2. Press F12
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console (trash icon)
5. Login
6. Copy ALL console output
7. Paste here

OR

Take screenshot of browser console and share

===============================================
THIS IS CRITICAL!
===============================================

I cannot help without seeing the browser console.
The terminal only shows compilation, not runtime data.
