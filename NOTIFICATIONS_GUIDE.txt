NOTIFICATIONS FEATURE - HOW IT WORKS
=====================================

## What Are Notifications For?

Notifications in your Expenses Tracker app are designed to alert you about important financial events:

1. **Budget Alerts**
   - When you're approaching your budget limit (80% spent)
   - When you exceed your budget (over 100%)
   - Helps you stay within your spending limits

2. **Recurring Bill Reminders**
   - Alerts when bills are due soon
   - Reminds you about upcoming payments
   - Prevents late payment fees

3. **Expense Milestones**
   - When you reach certain spending thresholds
   - Monthly spending summaries
   - Category-wise spending alerts

## How to Get Notifications:

### Currently, notifications are created by:

1. **Budget Monitoring**
   - Create a budget in the Budgets page
   - When your expenses in that category reach 80% of the limit
   - System automatically creates a notification

2. **Recurring Bills**
   - Add recurring bills in the Bills page
   - System checks due dates
   - Creates notifications 3 days before due date

3. **Manual Notifications**
   - Backend can create custom notifications
   - Admin or system-generated alerts

## How to View Notifications:

1. Click the **Bell icon** in the navigation bar
2. Go to **Notifications** page
3. See all your alerts and reminders
4. Mark them as read

## Current Limitations:

The notification system is currently **backend-based only**:
- No email notifications
- No push notifications
- No SMS alerts
- Only visible in the app

## How to Test Notifications:

### Test 1: Budget Alert
1. Create a budget: Category "Food", Limit ₹1000
2. Add expenses in "Food" category totaling ₹850 (85%)
3. System should create a notification: "Budget alert for Food"

### Test 2: Bill Reminder
1. Create a recurring bill with due date 2 days from now
2. System should create notification: "Bill due soon"

### Future Enhancements Needed:

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when budget exceeded
   - Email reminders for bills

2. **Push Notifications**
   - Browser push notifications
   - Mobile app notifications

3. **Notification Preferences**
   - Choose which alerts to receive
   - Set notification frequency
   - Customize alert thresholds

4. **Real-time Alerts**
   - Instant notifications when events occur
   - WebSocket-based live updates

## Why You Might Not See Notifications:

1. **No budgets created** - Create budgets to get budget alerts
2. **No bills added** - Add recurring bills to get bill reminders
3. **Expenses below threshold** - Spend more to trigger budget alerts
4. **Bills not due soon** - Set bills with near due dates

## To Get Notifications Right Now:

**Quick Test:**
1. Go to Budgets → Create Budget
   - Category: Food
   - Limit: ₹500
   - Start Date: Today
   - End Date: End of month

2. Go to Expenses → Add Expense
   - Category: Food
   - Amount: ₹450 (90% of budget)

3. Go to Notifications page
   - You should see a budget alert!

**Note:** The notification system needs backend logic to automatically create notifications. Currently, it's a basic implementation that stores notifications in the database.
