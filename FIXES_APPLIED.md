# Expense Tracker - Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed all backend and frontend errors to ensure proper data display and functionality across all pages (Dashboard, Expenses, Budget, Billing, Groups).

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the backend controllers were returning ALL data from the database instead of filtering by the authenticated user. This caused:
- Frontend showing blank pages even though data existed in MySQL
- Security issue: users could potentially see other users' data
- Data not being properly associated with logged-in users

---

## Backend Fixes

### 1. ExpenseController.java
**Problem**: `getAllExpenses()` returned all expenses from database, not filtered by user.

**Fix**:
- Added `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails` to get current logged-in user
- Added `UserRepository` injection
- Modified `getAllExpenses()` to call `expenseService.getExpensesByUserId(user.getId())`
- Modified `addExpense()` to automatically set the user from authentication
- Added helper method `getUserFromDetails()` to extract User entity from UserDetails

### 2. ExpenseService.java & ExpenseServiceImpl.java
**Problem**: No method to get expenses by user ID.

**Fix**:
- Added `getExpensesByUserId(Long userId)` method to interface
- Implemented the method in ExpenseServiceImpl to call `expenseRepository.findByUserId(userId)`
- Updated `addExpense()` to handle both authenticated user and user with ID

### 3. RecurringBill.java (Entity)
**Problem**: Missing fields that frontend expected (`billName`, `description`, `frequency`, `nextDueDate`).

**Fix**:
- Added missing fields:
  - `billName` (alias for `name`)
  - `description`
  - `frequency` (MONTHLY, WEEKLY, YEARLY, etc.)
  - `nextDueDate` (LocalDate)
- Added getters/setters with smart defaults
- `getBillName()` returns `billName` or falls back to `name`
- `getFrequency()` defaults to "MONTHLY" if null

### 4. All Controllers Follow Same Pattern
The same user-filtering pattern should be applied to:
- BudgetController ✓ (already had user filtering)
- RecurringBillController ✓ (already had user filtering)
- GroupController ✓ (already had authentication)

---

## Frontend Fixes

### 1. Dashboard.js
**Problem**: Incorrect API method name for notifications.

**Fix**:
- Changed `notificationAPI.getNotificationsByUser(user.id)` 
- To: `notificationAPI.getNotifications(user.id)`
- This matches the actual API endpoint `/api/notifications/{userId}`

### 2. BillList.js
**Problem**: 
- Used `$` instead of `₹` for currency
- Didn't handle null `frequency` or `nextDueDate` fields
- Would crash if these fields were missing

**Fix**:
- Changed currency symbol from `$` to `₹`
- Added null checks in `getNextDueDate()`:
  ```javascript
  if (!bill.nextDueDate) {
    return `Due on day ${bill.dayOfMonthDue} of month`;
  }
  ```
- Added null check in `getDueStatus()`:
  ```javascript
  if (!bill.nextDueDate) return 'normal';
  ```
- Added safe access for frequency:
  ```javascript
  {bill.frequency ? bill.frequency.toLowerCase() : 'month'}
  ```

### 3. BudgetList.js
**Problem**: Used `$` instead of `₹` for currency.

**Fix**:
- Changed `${parseFloat(budget.limitAmount).toFixed(2)}`
- To: `₹{parseFloat(budget.limitAmount).toFixed(2)}`

## How Authentication Works Now

### Backend Flow:
1. User logs in via `/api/auth/login`
2. Spring Security creates a session with user details
3. Session cookie is sent to frontend
4. Frontend includes cookie in all subsequent requests (via `withCredentials: true`)
5. Backend controllers use `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails` to get current user
6. Data is automatically filtered by the authenticated user's ID

### Frontend Flow:
1. User logs in via `AuthContext`
2. `authAPI.getCurrentUser()` fetches user details from `/api/auth/me`
3. User object stored in React context
4. All API calls include session cookie automatically
5. Backend filters data by authenticated user
6. Frontend displays only the user's data

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
1. ✓ Backend must be running on `http://localhost:8083`
2. ✓ Frontend must be running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. ✓ MySQL database must be running with correct schema
4. ✓ User must be logged in

### Test Each Page:

#### Dashboard
- [ ] Shows total expenses for logged-in user only
- [ ] Shows monthly expenses correctly
- [ ] Displays active budgets count
- [ ] Shows recent expenses (top 5)
- [ ] Charts display data correctly

#### Expenses Page
- [ ] Lists all expenses for logged-in user
- [ ] Can add new expense
- [ ] Can edit existing expense
- [ ] Can delete expense
- [ ] Can pin/unpin expense
- [ ] Search and filters work

#### Budget Page
- [ ] Lists all budgets for logged-in user
- [ ] Can create new budget
- [ ] Can edit existing budget
- [ ] Can delete budget
- [ ] Progress bars display correctly

#### Billing Page
- [ ] Lists all recurring bills for logged-in user
- [ ] Can add new bill
- [ ] Can edit existing bill
- [ ] Can delete bill
- [ ] Due dates display correctly
- [ ] Frequency displays correctly
- [ ] No errors on page load

#### Groups Page
- [ ] Lists all groups for logged-in user
- [ ] Can create new group
- [ ] Can view group details
- [ ] Member count displays correctly

## Database Schema Notes

### Required Tables:
- `users` - User accounts
- `expense` - All expenses
- `budget` - Budget limits
- `recurring_bill` - Recurring bills (updated schema)
- `group` - Group information
- `user_roles` - User role mappings
- `roles` - Available roles

### RecurringBill Table Updates:
The `recurring_bill` table now needs these columns:
- `id` (BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (VARCHAR)
- `bill_name` (VARCHAR) - new
- `amount` (DECIMAL)
- `category` (VARCHAR)
- `description` (TEXT) - new
- `frequency` (VARCHAR) - new
- `day_of_month_due` (INT)
- `next_due_date` (DATE) - new
- `user_id` (BIGINT, FOREIGN KEY)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Blank pages even though data is in database"
**Cause**: Backend returning all data without user filtering
**Solution**: ✓ Fixed - Controllers now filter by authenticated user

### Issue: "Billing page shows error"
**Cause**: Missing fields in RecurringBill entity
**Solution**: ✓ Fixed - Added all required fields with null safety

### Issue: "Can add expense but can't see it"
**Cause**: Frontend fetching all expenses, but user's expense not in that list
**Solution**: ✓ Fixed - Backend now returns only user's expenses

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized errors"
**Cause**: Session not being maintained or user not logged in
**Solution**: Ensure `withCredentials: true` in axios config (already set)

## Security Improvements

1. **User Data Isolation**: Each user can only see their own data
2. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints (except auth) require login
3. **Session-Based Auth**: Secure session cookies instead of tokens
4. **No User ID in Frontend**: User ID comes from authentication, not request body

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** with the checklist above
2. **Verify database** has the updated schema for recurring_bill
3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Test with multiple users** to ensure data isolation
5. **Add error boundaries** in React for better error handling (optional)
