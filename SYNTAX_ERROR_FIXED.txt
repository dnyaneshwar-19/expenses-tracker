===============================================
✅ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!
===============================================

The Dashboard.js file had duplicate sections that were causing the JSX error.

WHAT WAS WRONG:
- The file had duplicate stat cards
- The file had duplicate chart sections
- Multiple root JSX elements without a wrapper
- This caused "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped" error

WHAT I FIXED:
- Removed all duplicate sections
- File now has proper structure:
  1. Dashboard wrapper div (opens)
  2. Header
  3. Stats grid (4 cards)
  4. Charts grid (2 charts)
  5. Recent activity
  6. Dashboard wrapper div (closes)

FILE SIZE:
- Before: 303 lines (broken)
- After: 233 lines (fixed)

===============================================
WHAT TO DO NOW:
===============================================

1. The npm start should automatically reload
2. Check your browser - error should be gone
3. You should see the LOGIN PAGE now
4. Login with your credentials
5. Dashboard should load

If browser still shows error:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- Or close browser and reopen

===============================================
NEXT STEPS AFTER LOGIN:
===============================================

1. Dashboard will show:
   - Total Expenses: ₹0.00 (if no data)
   - This Month: ₹0.00 (if no data)
   - Active Budgets: 0 (if no data)
   - Charts may show "No Data"
   - Recent expenses may be empty

2. Open Browser Console (F12) and look for:
   "Fetching dashboard data for user: X"
   "Raw expenses response: [...]"

3. Add an expense:
   - Click "Expenses" in navbar
   - Click "Add Expense"
   - Fill the form
   - Submit
   - Check if it appears

4. Share console output with me if issues persist

===============================================
THE APP SHOULD WORK NOW!
