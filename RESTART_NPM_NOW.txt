ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: RESTART NPM TO CLEAR CACHE
===============================================

The Dashboard.js file is NOW FIXED (233 lines, no errors).

BUT the browser is showing the OLD cached version (303 lines with errors).

YOU MUST DO THIS:
===============================================

1. Go to the terminal running npm start
2. Press Ctrl+C to STOP it
3. Wait for it to stop completely
4. Run: npm start
5. Wait for "Compiled successfully"
6. Browser will auto-refresh

===============================================
STEP BY STEP:
===============================================

Terminal 1 (Frontend):
----------------------
1. Press Ctrl+C
2. Wait for prompt to return
3. Type: npm start
4. Press Enter
5. Wait for "webpack compiled successfully"

Browser:
--------
1. Will auto-reload
2. Should show login page (NO ERROR)
3. If still shows error, press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)

===============================================
WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
===============================================

Webpack caches the compiled files in memory.
Even though the source file is fixed, webpack is still
serving the old broken version from its cache.

Restarting npm clears this cache and forces webpack
to recompile from the fixed source file.

===============================================
AFTER NPM RESTARTS:
===============================================

âœ… Error should be GONE
âœ… Login page should appear
âœ… Can login and see dashboard
âœ… Dashboard shows â‚¹ currency
âœ… Can add expenses

===============================================
DO THIS NOW - RESTART NPM!
===============================================
