# Login Issue - Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified
Login was failing even with correct credentials because:
1. **Missing CORS Configuration** - Backend wasn't allowing cross-origin requests from frontend
2. **Session Cookie Issues** - Cookies weren't being shared between localhost:3000 and localhost:8083

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CORS Configuration
**File:** `expenses_tracker_backend/src/main/java/com/expenses_tracker/config/CorsConfig.java`

- Allows requests from `http://localhost:3000`
- Enables credentials (cookies)
- Allows all HTTP methods
- Exposes necessary headers

### 2. Updated Security Configuration
**File:** `expenses_tracker_backend/src/main/java/com/expenses_tracker/config/SecurityConfig.java`

- Added session management configuration
- Set session creation policy to `IF_REQUIRED`
- Limited to 1 concurrent session per user

### 3. Updated Auth Controller
**File:** `expenses_tracker_backend/src/main/java/com/expenses_tracker/controller/AuthController.java`

- Added `@CrossOrigin` annotation with `allowCredentials = true`
- Ensures cookies are properly sent to frontend

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Stop Backend (if running)
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the backend

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
cd expenses_tracker_backend
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Wait for the message: "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication"

### Step 3: Test Login

1. **Open Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Try Login** with your registered credentials
3. **Should work now!** ✅

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- ❌ CORS errors in browser console
- ❌ Session cookies not being set
- ❌ Login always fails with "Invalid credentials"

### After:
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Session cookies work across origins
- ✅ Login succeeds and redirects to dashboard
- ✅ User stays logged in across page refreshes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend restarted successfully
- [ ] Frontend shows login page
- [ ] Can register new user
- [ ] Can login with registered credentials
- [ ] Redirects to dashboard after login
- [ ] Can see user data in dashboard
- [ ] Can navigate to other pages
- [ ] Stays logged in after page refresh

## Technical Details

### CORS Configuration
```java
- Allowed Origins: http://localhost:3000
- Allow Credentials: true
- Allowed Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
- Allowed Headers: *
- Exposed Headers: Authorization, Set-Cookie
```

### Session Management
```java
- Session Creation: IF_REQUIRED
- Maximum Sessions: 1
- Cookie Name: JSESSIONID
- Cookie Path: /
- HttpOnly: true
```

### Frontend Configuration
```javascript
- Base URL: http://localhost:8083/api
- withCredentials: true
- Content-Type: application/json
```

## Troubleshooting

### If login still fails:

1. **Clear Browser Cookies**:
   - Press F12 (DevTools)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear all cookies for localhost

2. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Look for authentication errors
   - Check if user exists in database

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Check network tab for 401/403 errors

4. **Verify Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'your_username';
   ```
   - Ensure user exists
   - Password should be BCrypt encrypted (starts with $2a$)

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Invalid credentials" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using the exact username/password from registration

**Issue**: CORS error in console
- **Solution**: Backend needs to be restarted after applying fixes

**Issue**: Cookie not being set
- **Solution**: Check that `withCredentials: true` is in frontend api.js

**Issue**: 401 Unauthorized after login
- **Solution**: Session might not be persisting, check SecurityConfig

## Success Indicators

When everything works correctly, you should see:

1. **In Browser DevTools (Network tab)**:
   - POST to `/api/auth/login` returns 200 OK
   - Response includes `Set-Cookie` header with JSESSIONID
   - Subsequent requests include Cookie header

2. **In Browser Console**:
   - No CORS errors
   - No authentication errors

3. **In Application**:
   - Login redirects to dashboard
   - User info displays correctly
   - Can navigate to all pages
   - Stays logged in after refresh

## Next Steps

After login works:
1. ✅ Test all features (expenses, budgets, groups)
2. ✅ Test logout functionality
3. ✅ Test session persistence
4. ✅ Test with multiple users
