===============================================
✅ BACKEND FIX APPLIED - RESTART BACKEND NOW!
===============================================

THE PROBLEM:
------------
The backend was returning 500 Internal Server Error because:
- User entity has lazy-loaded collections (expenses, groups)
- When Jackson tries to serialize Expense objects to JSON
- It includes the User object
- Which tries to load lazy collections
- Session is closed → ERROR

THE FIX:
--------
Added @JsonIgnore to User.expenses and User.groups
This prevents Jackson from trying to serialize these collections

FILES CHANGED:
--------------
✅ User.java - Added @JsonIgnore annotations
✅ User.java - Added import for JsonIgnore

===============================================
YOU MUST RESTART BACKEND NOW!
===============================================

1. Go to terminal running backend
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it
3. Wait for it to stop
4. Run: mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
5. Wait for "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication"

===============================================
AFTER RESTART:
===============================================

1. Keep frontend running (don't restart)
2. Go to browser
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Login again
5. Go to Dashboard
6. Check console - should see:
   ✅ "Fetching dashboard data for user: 1"
   ✅ "Raw expenses response: []" (or with data)
   ✅ NO MORE 500 ERRORS!

7. Go to Expenses page
8. Add an expense
9. Should appear in list immediately!

===============================================
WHAT THIS FIXES:
===============================================

✅ Dashboard 500 error - FIXED
✅ Expenses 500 error - FIXED
✅ Can fetch expenses - FIXED
✅ Can add expenses - FIXED
✅ Data will display - FIXED

===============================================
RESTART BACKEND NOW!
===============================================

mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

Wait for: "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication"
