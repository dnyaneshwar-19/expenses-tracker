## 🚀 Steps to Run the Application on Your Laptop

> 🧩 **Prerequisite:** Install and Sign in to **Docker Desktop**

---

### **Step 1: Install Docker Desktop**

- Go to 👉 [Docker Desktop Official Site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Download and install for **Windows** or **Mac**
- Launch Docker and ensure it shows:  
  ✅ _“Docker Desktop is running”_ (whale icon turns green)

---

### **Step 2: Prepare the Project Files**

1. Create a folder on your Desktop named **my-expenses-tracker**
2. Place the provided file `expenses_tracker_runInDocker.rar` inside it
3. Extract the `.rar` file
4. Make sure your folder structure looks like this:

```

my-expenses-tracker/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── init-db/
└── backup.sql

```

> ⚠️ Important: The `docker-compose.yml` file **must** be directly inside `my-expenses-tracker/` (not in a subfolder).

---

### **Step 3: Launch the Application**

Open **Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal**, then:

```bash
cd path\to\my-expenses-tracker
docker compose up -d
```

> 🐳 Docker will automatically pull required images (backend, frontend, MySQL) and start everything in a private network.

---

### **Step 4: Access the Application**

Wait about 1 minute for services to start, then open:

👉 **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**

The app will load with initial demo data.
Any new data you add will be stored **persistently** on your machine.
