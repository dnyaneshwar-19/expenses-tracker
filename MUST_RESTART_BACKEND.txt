üö® YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND! üö®
===============================================

THE CODE IS FIXED BUT NOT RUNNING!

The User.java file has the @JsonIgnore annotations.
BUT the backend is still running the OLD compiled code.

YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER!

===============================================
HOW TO RESTART BACKEND:
===============================================

1. Find the terminal running the backend
   (The one that says "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication")

2. Click on that terminal window

3. Press Ctrl+C to STOP the backend
   (You'll see it shutting down)

4. Wait until you see the command prompt again

5. Type this command:
   mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

6. Press Enter

7. WAIT for this message:
   "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication in X.XXX seconds"

8. You should also see:
   "Tomcat started on port(s): 8083"

===============================================
AFTER BACKEND RESTARTS:
===============================================

1. Go back to browser
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Login again
4. The 500 errors should be GONE
5. Dashboard should load
6. Expenses should load
7. You can add expenses and see them

===============================================
WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
===============================================

Java code needs to be COMPILED before it runs.
When you start the backend, it compiles the code.
Changes to .java files are NOT automatically picked up.
You MUST restart the backend to compile new changes.

===============================================
CURRENT STATUS:
===============================================

‚úÖ User.java has @JsonIgnore - CORRECT
‚úÖ Import is added - CORRECT
‚ùå Backend NOT restarted - PROBLEM
‚ùå Still running old code - PROBLEM

===============================================
RESTART THE BACKEND NOW!
===============================================

Terminal command:
cd expenses_tracker_backend
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

Wait for: "Started ExpensesTrackerApplication"

Then test in browser!

===============================================
