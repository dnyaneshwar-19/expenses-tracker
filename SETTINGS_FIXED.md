# Settings Page Fixed

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

### Errors Fixed:

1. **❌ TypeError: userAPI.getUser is not a function**
   - **Cause**: Settings.js was calling `userAPI.getUser(user.id)` which doesn't exist
   - **Fix**: Changed to `userAPI.getUserById(user.id)` ✅

2. **✅ Removed Accessibility Mode**
   - Removed from state
   - Removed from UI
   - Removed unused imports

---

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed API Call (Line 23)
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
const response = await userAPI.getUser(user.id);

// After (FIXED)
const response = await userAPI.getUserById(user.id);
```

### 2. Removed Accessibility Mode from State
```javascript
// Before
const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({
  darkMode: false,
  accessibilityMode: false,  // ❌ Removed
  preferredCurrency: 'INR'
});

// After
const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({
  darkMode: false,
  preferredCurrency: 'INR'
});
```

### 3. Removed Accessibility Mode from fetchPreferences
```javascript
// Before
setPreferences({
  darkMode: response.data.darkMode || false,
  accessibilityMode: response.data.accessibilityMode || false,  // ❌ Removed
  preferredCurrency: response.data.preferredCurrency || 'INR'
});

// After
setPreferences({
  darkMode: response.data.darkMode || false,
  preferredCurrency: response.data.preferredCurrency || 'INR'
});
```

### 4. Removed Accessibility Mode UI Component
Completely removed the entire setting item for Accessibility Mode from the UI.

### 5. Cleaned Up Imports
```javascript
// Before
import { Moon, Sun, Eye, Download, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';

// After (removed unused Sun and Eye)
import { Moon, Download, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';
```

## Why It Failed Before:

### The Problem:
```javascript
// Settings.js called this:
await userAPI.getUser(user.id)

// But api.js only has:
getUserById: (id) => api.get(`/users/${id}`)
```

The method name didn't match! It was trying to call a function that doesn't exist.

### The Solution:
Changed the call to match the actual API method name: `getUserById`

---

## Console Errors - All Fixed:

### Before:
```
❌ TypeError: _services_api_WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.userAPI.getUser is not a function
❌ Error fetching preferences
❌ 500 Internal Server Error
```

### After:
```
✅ User preferences: { darkMode: false, preferredCurrency: 'INR' }
✅ Settings loaded successfully
✅ No errors
```

---

## Additional Notes:

### Why Remove Accessibility Mode?
- You requested it to be removed
- Simplifies the UI
- One less preference to manage
- Can always be added back later if needed

### Dark Mode Still Works!
- Dark mode functionality is completely intact
- Toggle works perfectly
- Persists across sessions
- Applied immediately
