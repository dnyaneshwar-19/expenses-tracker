✅ DASHBOARD FIXED - START THE APP NOW!
===============================================

The syntax error is fixed. Now:

1. The frontend should start without errors
2. You should see the login page
3. Login and test the dashboard

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
1. Make sure npm start is still running
   (If not, run: npm start)

2. Browser should open automatically
   (If not, go to: http://localhost:3000)

3. You should see LOGIN PAGE now (not error)

4. Login with your credentials

5. Dashboard should show:
   - Total Expenses in ₹
   - This Month in ₹
   - Active Budgets count
   - Notifications count
   - Charts (may show "No Data" if no expenses yet)
   - Recent Expenses (may be empty if no expenses yet)

6. Open Browser Console (F12) and look for:
   "Fetching dashboard data for user: X"
   "Raw expenses response: [...]"
   
7. Take screenshot of console and share with me

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
After dashboard loads:
1. Click "Expenses" in navbar
2. Click "Add Expense"
3. Fill the form
4. Submit
5. Check if it appears in the list
6. Share screenshot if it doesn't work

===============================================
The app should work now! Test it and let me know.
