‚úÖ Shows stats in ‚Çπ (Rupees)

WHAT TO TEST NOW:
===============================================

1. LOGIN
   - Go to http://localhost:3000

3. ADD EXPENSE

4. CHECK CONSOLE
   - Press F12 to open console
   - Look for these logs:
     "Fetching dashboard data for user: X"
     "Raw expenses response: [...]"
   - This shows data is being fetched

===============================================
WHAT'S FIXED:
===============================================

‚úÖ Dashboard.js syntax error - FIXED

===============================================
WHAT STILL NEEDS FIXING (if issues):
===============================================

If you encounter these issues, let me know:

‚ùå Expenses don't show after adding
   ‚Üí Check console for API response
   ‚Üí Share the console output

‚ùå Budget progress is wrong
   ‚Üí Will fix calculation logic

‚ùå Bills page error
   ‚Üí Will fix toLowerCase issue

‚ùå Groups don't show

===============================================
NEXT STEPS:

1. Test the dashboard - does it load?
2. Add an expense - does it appear?
3. Check browser console - what does it say?
4. Share any errors you see
5. I'll fix remaining issues

===============================================
IMPORTANT CONSOLE LOGS TO CHECK:
===============================================

When you login and go to dashboard, you should see:

‚úÖ "Fetching dashboard data for user: X"
‚úÖ "Raw expenses response: [...]"
‚úÖ "Raw budgets response: [...]"
‚úÖ "Dashboard stats calculated: {...}"

If you see errors instead, share them with me.
